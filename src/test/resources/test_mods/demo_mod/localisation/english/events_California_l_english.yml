 california.1.t:0 "First Major Election"
 california.1.d:0 "Since the secession from the Union our prior president sadly passed away. Nevertheless acting President Frank Merriam is currently in the running under the Republican Party, which is backed by the political establishment during this race to prevent Upton Sinclair from winning. Merriams opponent is someone who proclaims to not be an extremist but is regarded by the establishment as one, Upton Sinclair is the leader of the End Poverty In California (EPIC) movement. Worker's unions' are in support as well as some socialists. If he were to win the election a political revolution would be underway in California."

 california.3.t:0 "The Phoenix Speech"
 california.3.d:0 "I will be brief in my comments. I was appointed many months ago to get the victory that, until moments ago, many in a foolheardty legislation thought impossible. Now I stand before you, the broken and tired enemy. I wish to make one thing clear to you; It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived. In this model, we have seen a truth and understanding to our great American ideal, a process of hope for a reunification. Americans, across everywhere, will sooner or later be damned into uniting with eachother, for an American cannot live without associating with his other fellow Americans. Lincoln taught us that. Lincoln also taught us to not hide ourselves, to piss away, from an advantageous position, even if it meant the forceful nature that we Americans love to use. When I was offered the position months ago to take charge of this great State and to seek an immediate conclusion to threats other Americans posed to us, I accepted because of the shit-slinging belly-up bastard aching that I saw in our Capitol hill. I will remind you all of what I said many months ago, in exactly that situation taking office; A good solution applied with vigor now is better than a perfect solution applied ten minutes later. This has been a tough, brutal, and devestating fight. In time, you may hate us for our conquering. But you will be reminded and you will be led, for you are an American. And Americans, even if they hate every other place on earth, will, in the end, have to be together with other Americans. Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of the men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory. And through our victory, by thanking the alive and by serving together, we can achieve an everlasting glory. Right, you damn Bolshevik naysayers!, you get what I mean, we'll take back our nation and we'll keep on moving at the bastards. That's all"
 california.3.a:0 "Old Blood and Guts achieves another victory!"

 california.4.t:0 "Seperate but Equal Questioned in the California Senate"
 california.4.d:0 "For the half a decade our newly founded country existed, we have opted to not make any conversation about the old federal laws still in our books.

We are all equal under the eyes of the constitution, Our forefathers, and Great Bear flag of the revolution!§R"

 california.5.t:0 "Military Segregation in Question"
 california.5.d:0 "During our time as apart of the federal government we followed laws that were popular with the Majority. THese werent always the right thing to do. Hopefully now we can fix these issues aswell as giving our Military a more diverse and larger force."
 california.5.a:0 "We must put our past behind us"
 
 
 
 california.10.t:0 "Communist Rebellion!"
 california.10.d:0 "The outbreak of the second longshoreman strike has now shifted into a full rebellion as disgruntled Chicano Workers and Socialists unite together to liberate the workers of California. Harry Bridges has taken the reins of this rebellion as it’s leader. The “People Republic of California” was proclaimed in San Francisco. Los Angeles has declared loyalty to the communist cause as other counties in Southern California followed suit. George S. Patton has declared this rebellion traitorous in every ounce of the word. With only the territory of Jefferson and Sacramento as a stronghold for Legion support. It seems victory won't be certain."
 california.10.a:0 "Rally the Army!"
 california.10.b:0 "Break The Chains!"

 california.89.t:0 "Idaho's Government Has Failed Them!"
 california.89.d:0 "Patton today gave a speech to thousands in Sacramento about the decadency of Idaho's current government, he is advocating that our duty as californians, and Americans is to overthrow this corrupt government and replace it with a government Patton could agree on."
 california.89.a:0 "A agressive but necessary measure."

 
 california.93.t:0 "Hawaii Offers To Buy Destroyer"
 california.93.d:0 "Hawaii, looking to expand heavily in navy to defend themselves from Japan, has reached out to us. The recest economic projects have proven successful, and with some money to spare, they've reached out with an offer. With our position, we could sure use some money. Is this really the way?"
 california.93.a:0 "We need the money..."
 california.93.b:0 "We can't sell off our navy!"


 california.35.t:0 "Zoot Suit Riots!"
 california.35.d:0 "The Mexican-American community in Los Angeles has always been plagued by violence and gangs due to their impoverished and underclass status. Mexican street youth have taken up the fashion trend of 'Zoot Suits' a long jacket with baggy pants. During our current war these street youth have begun clashing with our military personnel stationed in the city since many working class Mexicans have been displaced by military installation expansion within the city. Tensions were high between the military and the Zoot Suiters and now they have boiled over into a riot after our sailors had an altercation with some Zoot-Suiters. Los Angeles has been racked by violence since this altercation and Mexicans are activley protesting against our war effort."
 california.35.a:0 "Crush these uppity unpatriotic vermin!"
 
 california.36.t:0 "Stockton Cannery Strike!"
 california.36.d:0 "The city of Stockton has recently been flooded by migrants from dustbowl effected areas and Mexico. The arrival of new people when the job market was already desperate fueled the decline of agricultural wages. The Agricultural Worker's organization in Stockton demanded higher pay, when this demand was refused the workers went on strike! The strike has already begun spreading to nearby agricultural towns in the San Joaquin valley. What should our course of action be?"
 california.36.a:0 "Send in the National Guard!"
 california.36.b:0 "Negotiate a deal with the union's less radical leaders..."

 california.21.t:0 "Communist Forces Organize"
 california.21.d:0 "The 1936 election's cancellation has caused radical forces to openly mobilize against our government. The Communists led by Harry Bridges have now tried to appeal to the Chicano Workers of the Central Valley to reel them into their side. And it seems it was a success as the Central Valley is no longer siding with us. And now reserves of the Californian army have defected to the Communists only strengthening their grip on their territory. We can only hope the situation can calm down or else we suffer an insurrection."
 california.21.a:0 "The Reds need to be stopped."

 california.22.t:0 "Patton Requests Harsher Measures"
 california.22.d:0 "General George S. Patton requests for the National Guard take harsher measures to dispatch the strikes and the Communist forces. Marriam has bent the knee and has given the National Guard permisssion to take more violent means to destroy the strikes. Now however this has given the Reds more reasons to fight against. This move especially has turned moderate figures into accusing our government of playing into the hands of fascists and has given the Reds all the more reason to revolt."
 california.22.a:0 "We have very little choice."

 california.23.t:0 "EPIC declares loyality to the Commmunists"
 california.23.d:0 "'My fellow Compatriots and Supporters of the Progressive Cause. It was until the cancellation of the election that we put our trust in the administration of Frank Merriam to carry out a democratic election. However the strikes occurred, ending the democratic process and revealing to us the true face of the so called Republic of California. Instead of being an aid to the workers, they fired their guns, shot the Longshoreman, and push this nation further into turmoil. This violation of the democratic process and the outright tyrannical course of action the Merriam administration had done has forced my hand. Our ultimately failed campaign to bring socialism to California will not die in vain at the hands of the twisted Republicans. I, Upton Sinclair, will officially declare that EPIC will no longer participate in the so called Republic of California. We will give our graditude to the Communist forces of Harry Bridges for their active fight against the tyrants of Sacramento. While we may believe in the ideals of Progressivism, we can no longer stand by and act like the Republic of California is at all just in their actions. And we may only hope that in the future, our movement will not die in vain at the hands Fascists or Overreaching Communists.'"
 california.23.a:0 "They were masquerading Reds anyways"

 california.24.t:0 "Californians Flee To Nevada"
 california.24.d:0 "Reports of Californians crossing the border to Nevada have been found. Seemingly this is due to the massive political strife we are facing now and with what seems to be a massive insurrection upcoming, Californians are fleeing to avoid this. Our nations is now falling further and further into total chaos."
 california.24.a:0 "This has to end"

 california.25.t:0 "Martial Law Declared"
 california.25.d:0 "As our final resort, Merriam has imposed Martial Law to prevent the Communist forces from gaining any more ground. Patton has declared that Martial Law is not enough to stop the Reds, only a complete government takeover of California can end this crisis. Despite all we've done, Harry Bridges has declared that his forces begin to soldify their positions. Currently from our reports, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and many cities in the Central Valley are under control of the Communists. Merriam's Administration has failed to control the situation and in the next few days we are expecting his government to fall to the hands of Patton. There is no peaceful solution to be found at this point."
 california.25.a:0 "Too Little. Too Late"

 california.26.t:0 "Republican Party Collapses"
 california.26.d:0 "Due to Merriam's administrative failure to control the situation and for his supposed tyranny for cancelling the election due to the strikes. The Republican Party of California has collapsed. With Congress in utter shambles, General George S. Patton has declared the end of the Republic of California and the formation of a new government. With Frank Merriam unable to do anything about it. Patton has promised to crush the communist forces and assume total control over the nation in the effort to save California from a socialist takeover. The Republic of Nevada has condemned our actions of "Subverting the Democratic Process". Harry Bridges has also stated that this takeover was "inevitable". With our nation now facing an unavoidable civil war, we cannot afford to be weakened by the Spineless Merriam or the Leftist Bastards of Sinclair or Bridges. Patton and his Legion will redeem the mistakes of the past government, bringing California to a new golden age. Glory to Patton, Glory to the Legion!"
 california.26.a:0 "Only Patton Can Save Us Now"

 commiecali.2.t:0 "Bridges' Speech"
 commiecali.2.d:0 "Comrades one and all, the time is now that we begin our struggle for the total liberation of California. Our ideals have been realized now in the past few weeks and now there is no turning back. The Fascist Government of Patton stands no chance against the army of the people. In this struggle against this Fascist Stain, sacrifices have to be made to achieve the Victory of Socialism in California. To all our soldiers, be courageous, be swift, and be victorious. Mobilize every reserve, every arms factory, and every force for the People's War. We cannot let our newfound nation fall to the bourgeoisie or the fascists. But now at this moment we will offically wage our war against the Californian Government. And we will procede. Glory to the Revolution, Glory to the People, and Glory to the ideals of Socialism!"
 commiecali.2.a:0 "To Arms!"

 commiecali.3.t:0 "End of The Civil War"
 commiecali.3.d:0 "The Workers of California have been liberated and Patton's fascist government has fallen to the might of socialism. However this Civil War has devasted the lands and as the various territories of Patton's Government are being reintegrated into the People's Republic, reactionaries and populists have made their way into government. Purges will soon have to conducted and economic recovery must be at the center of reconstruction, but the people of California can now live in a free socialist nation."
 commiecali.3.a:0 "Reactionaries have no place in California"

 california.27.t:0 "Rumors of Military Coup Spread"
 california.27.d:0 "In the advent of California's first election, recent rumors of a military coup being executed are circulating. Advisors of Frank Merriam and Congressmen have been discussing if these rumors may very well be true. While Merriam has been confident in his reasoning that Patton nor the Military would ever betray the Republic like this. Merriam has refused to waste Military personel defending Sacramento from a so called coup."
 california.27.a:0 "It would be Treason then, Patton surely wouldn't commit Treason. Right?"

 california.28.t:0 "Alleged Disney Plot"
 california.28.d:0 "The rumors still continue and now it appears Disney may be in on it. Reports of Disney funds going to Military equipment and even Paramilitary groups are being cited as evidence for a coup being plotted. Merriam has still refused to look into the case. Congress has gone uneasy about if this coup may be reality. While Military presence has still not been increased in Sacramento."
 california.28.a:0 "Disney isn't the type of Man to do this"

 california.29.t:0 "Reports of Unauthorized Military Personel in Sacramento"
 california.29.d:0 "During a session of Congress. Sightings of unknown Military personel and Artillery being set up have been reported. While these unknown personel are Californian, there was no order for Military personel to appear in Sacramento. Most concerning of all is the Artillery being set up near the Capitol buliding. It is unknown if this is tied to the rumored coup."
 california.29.a:0 "No, it just can't happen here..."
