Early on, it was recognized as one of the finest natural harbors in the world due to its depth and natural defense from the Atlantic as a result of the many islands that dot the harbor. It was also favored due to its access to the local rivers which made travel from the harbor deeper into the industrial cities of Massachusetts far easier. \nIt was the site of the Boston Tea Party, as by 1660, almost all imports came to the greater Boston area and the New England coast through the waters of Boston Harbor."

Just off the fort, in Buzzards Bay, was the first naval engagement of the American Revolution, the Battle off Fairhaven on 14 May 1775. On 5–6 September 1778, the fort was destroyed by the British when they raided the harbor. A force under Major Israel Fearing drove off the British, both at the fort and when they attempted an attack on the town. In 1784 it was given the name "Fort Phoenix" after the mythical bird that rose from its own ashes. \nThere is also a smaller cannon at the fort which was captured by the Continental Marines during the raid on Nassau in the Bahamas in 1776, the first amphibious landing on foreign soil by United States Marines."
